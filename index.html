    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm working as IT project management in one of IBMs companies in
      Indonesia. During my professional career, I've been switching 3 different
      roles. That's because I'm a type of person who keep exploring where myself
      is supposed to be. I'm trying to maximize my potential with align with
      passion. Till I found myself getting an opportunity becoming IT project
      manager for enhancement project in one of biggest e-commerce in Indonesia.
      Managing project is such challenging for me. I feel like I've found my
      passion that's managing project. Finally I decide to challenge myself
      heading into big challenge that is joining in IT consultant for project
      management specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love being around everything related to IT. That's why I keep exploring,
      learning and practicing by taking online course or following it from other
      source. Now I take seriously learning web development. I believe myself by
      giving my best effort I will be able to do it. The only thing that I need
      to do is, keep learning and practice in daily.
